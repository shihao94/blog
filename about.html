<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hi! My name is Shihao. I'm a (research scientist aiming at improving patients' life via quantitative analysis) & (life-long learner interested in science, personal development, investing, fitness and psychology) & (believer in experiences over possessions).
</p>

<p>
This is my personal blog to share my reading, life experiences and thoughts from them. I'm encouraged by <a href="https://stevepavlina.com/personal-development-for-smart-people/">a book</a> to start this blog to "creatively express ourselves" to the world and "honestly share what's most important to us". 
</p>

<p>
I write in both English and Chinese 中文。
