This is a page to be updated continuously to share my reading progress in science, personal development, investing and business, fitness, psychology and others. 

All opinions are certainly personal and biased. I look foward to discussion about these topics. 

# Science

# Personal development
- **Personal Development for Smart People**
by Steve Pavlina. Rating: 5 out of 5.

Despite the funny title, this is by far the best personal development book I have read. The author logically proposed a universal framework of personal development, based on several principles, including truth (admit the fact), love (connection) and power (ability to act and change the life). These principles are complimentary to each other and nonredundant. Also, the author delivers the information in a concise and clear way, which makes the book enjoyable to read when many authors nowadays tend to repeat the same contents over and over in writing.

- **Meditations** by Marcus Aurelius. Rating: 4 out of 5.

# Investing and business
- **我的创业史** by 刘强东, Rating: 5 out of 5

- **The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking** by Saifedean Ammous, Rating: 2.5 out of 5

The Bitcoin Reddit community recommended this book to me. In the first few chapters, the author clearly explains the concept of money as a tool for exchanging value and compares the "hardness" of various forms of money and fiat throughout history. This part is logical. But the middle section about government-issued fiat and its negative impacts on the economy and society feels a bit off-topic. Many of the arguments seem to be based on association rather than causation. The final chapters on the concept and use of Bitcoin are still valid but could be more concise. The whole book could be condensed to half its size.

# Fitness
- **Why we sleep** by Matthew Walker. Rating: 4 out of 5. 

This is a fascinating book that educates people about the importance of sleep and the good practice of sleep, which our education system and society have fail to do and even discourage people to do...I had sleep problems in my middle school and I wish I could read this book earlier. But for some health and society problems due to sleep deficiencies claimed by the author, causal relationship is not well established in my opinion. Nevertheless, I highly recommend people to read this illuminating book.
