This is a page to be updated continuously to share my reading progress in science, personal development, investing and business, fitness, psychology and others. 

All opinions are certainly personal and biased. I look foward to discussion about these topics. 

# Science

# Personal development
- **Personal Development for Smart People**
by Steve Pavlina. Rating: 5 out of 5.

Despite the funny title, this is by far the best personal development book I have read. The author logically proposed a universal framework of personal development, based on several principles, including truth (admit the fact), love (connection) and power (ability to act and change the life). These principles are complimentary to each other and nonredundant. Also, the author delivers the information in a concise and clear way, which makes the book enjoyable to read when many authors nowadays tend to repeat the same contents over and over in writing.
