Recently, several people on LinkedIn asked me how to land their first job as a researcher in the biopharma industry. Most of them are either finishing their PhDs or working as postdocs, with no prior industry experience. I understand how they feel—I was in their shoes two years ago, too busy with research and graduation to explore the industry. So, I’m sharing some thoughts based on my own experience.

**TL;DR**: Start building early connections (attend conferences, talk to people, pursue internships), and think from the company's perspective.

# Think Like a Hiring Manager

Let’s begin with the end in mind: imagine you're the hiring manager for a research scientist role. What would convince you to hire someone? In my experience, these are the top predictors of a strong candidate:

1. A trusted colleague recommends the candidate.
2. The candidate has demonstrated recognition in previous roles (e.g., promotions, awards, publications).
3. The candidate's skills match the job requirements.

Working backwards from these, here are some best actions you can take to improve your odds:

# 1. Get Trusted Recommendations

- **Leverage your lab network**: Ask your PI and lab alumni for referrals. They’re likely the only ones who’ve worked closely with you for a long time and can vouch for your abilities. If they are not in the industry, ask them to recommend you to someone who is.
- **Pursue internships**: An internship gives industry professionals a chance to see your work firsthand—and potentially recommend you.
- **Network deliberately**: Attend conferences and industry events (I met my hiring manager in at a conference). Present posters. Practice clear communication. Use Linkedin proactively. And do lots of informational interviews—I highly recommend the book [*Designing Your Life*](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful/dp/1101875321).

# 2. Show Evidence of Recognition

- This is often the biggest gap for first-time job seekers. Hiring managers may worry whether you can adapt to the faster pace and a complex environment of industry. 
- Publications and awards can serve as third-party validation of your research skills.
- Internships help bridge the experience gap and demonstrate your ability to work in a corporate setting.

# 3. Align Your Skills with the Role

- First, believe in your expertise—if you’ve completed a PhD, you are already an expert and strong enough technical skills.
- So the only question is **do you match?** Study job descriptions. Extract keywords and look for overlaps with your background and tailor your CV.
- If there’s a gap, consider training (e.g., bootcamps or certifications) to pivot into adjacent roles. Put down your ago a bit. Be open to joining a team that’s not a perfect fit initially; internal transfer is much easier once you're on the boat.

# The Interview Process

1. **HR screen:** This covers logistics like your graduation timeline and visa status. Really try to skip it via direct contact with a hiring manager (via network and a lot of informative interview). 
2. **Hiring Manager Interview**: A 30-minute call where the manager asks about your background. Prepare a clear summary of your work—why it mattered, what results you got, and how you did it. You typically have a few minutes at the end to ask one or two thoughtful questions (e.g., daily work, mentoring style). Don’t go overtime.
3. **Full-Day Interview**: This includes your research talk (typically 45-minute presentation + Q&A) and multiple 1-on-1s with your future colleagues. Your presentation is the single most important part—prepare thoroughly. I recommend reading [*The Craft of Scientific Presentations*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22722985-the-craft-of-scientific-presentations). Besides, keep updating your materials (CV, slides, your delivery, how you do the interview) as you get feedback from each interview. Think of each interview as a data point to iterate on. 

# A Final Thought

The job hunt process should typically take several months. 

It’s been over two years since I finished my PhD. The job market might have changed—possibly for the worse. But I want to end with a story.

In September 2023, I attended a conference in Seattle and spoke with two employees from the same small company that was about to be acquired. The first, a woman, was worried: “I might lose my job—my department is getting absorbed.” The second, a man I met one day later, responded calmly and confidently: “I’m not worried. Even if I lose this job, I’ll find another in a few weeks.”

I didn’t follow up with them. But that contrast has stayed with me. Same situation, different mindset. Your beliefs shape your actions. If you don’t believe you deserve the role, it’s hard for others to believe it either. But once you believe in yourself, others start to see it too.
